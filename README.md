# Advent of Code 2022

This year I am back to GoðŸš€

```bash
$ go version
go version go1.19.1 darwin/arm64
```

## How to run

```bash
$ cd aoc01
$ go run main.go < input/input.txt
```

## Day 12

It's obvious that this's a path finding problem just like [Day 23 of 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/23). Dijkstra to the rescue!
